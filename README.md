# School-Project-Dump
This is a place for some project from my time in school to be displayed publicly.
As of writing this, I have not really used GitHub. So, I am sorry if the formatting is bad.

I have cut out a lot of fluff, and uploaded the files as they were. If things seem inconsistent, it is generally because of course requirements.
Some projects I have few comments because I knew it was not important, some I have comments on every other statment to make sure the teacher can follow my logic. When making these, they were generally following some kind of outline for grading and covering topics.

Some quick, important, details:
1. For SQL, we used SSMS (SQL Server Managment Studio 18) by Mircosoft. The queries used to make the DB should be in the Final Project folder, and hopefully clearly labeled.

2. for the javascript course, we used index.html for all home pages. All pages should link to eachother anyways, but that is the intended start. The CSS/JS folders were also required to make sure we practiced good habits, I am aware they seem a little unnecessary. 

3. The Game Design class used Unity. GitHub did not want me doing any big uploads, so I did what I could to get the needed files in. In the folder, there should be zipped folders that will need to be unzipped. when those are decompressed, you should be able to run the .exe files to try the games. I made sure to grab the scripts used in the two games, they are in their own folder. We made a couple more games but they were more formulaic to help teach us Unity.
Also, yes, the final project is buggy. Something about using the tile map tools does not agree with the player collision (I assume...), you can try "jumping" when the player is stuck. I did it in about a weeks worth of time and do not know enough about the eingine to know why it is happening. I was also more focused on the random generation of the map anyways and wanted to make sure I had something to turn in.
