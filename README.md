# School-Project-Dump
This is a place for some project from my time in school to be displayed publicly.
As of writing this, I have not really used GitHub. So, I am sorry if the formatting is bad.

I have cut out a lot of fluff, and uploaded the files as they were. If things seem inconsistent, it is generally because of course requirements.
Some projects I have few comments because I knew it was not important, some I have comments on every other statment to make sure the teacher can follow my logic. When making these, they were generally following some kind of outline for grading and covering topics.
