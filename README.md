# School-Project-Dump
This is a place for some project from my time in school to be displayed publicly.
As of writing this, I have not really used GitHub. So, I am sorry if the formatting is bad.

I have cut out a lot of fluff, and uploaded the files as they were. If things seem inconsistent, it is generally because of course requirements.
Some projects I have few comments because I knew it was not important, some I have comments on every other statment to make sure the teacher can follow my logic. When making these, they were generally following some kind of outline for grading and covering topics.

Some quick, important, details:
1. For SQL, we used SSMS (SQL Server Managment Studio 18) by Mircosoft. The queries used to make the DB should be in the Final Project folder, and hopefully clearly labeled.

2. for the javascript course, we used index.html for all home pages. All pages should link to eachother anyways, but that is the intended start. The CSS/JS folders were also required to make sure we practiced good habits, I am aware they seem a little unnecessary. 

3. The Game Design class used Unity, in the folder, there should be a builds folder. In the builds folder, there should be an application you can run. These projects can be a little chaotic and I do not know how much can really be edited outside the editor so I did not tamper with them. The code should be found amongst the assets, hopefully in their own folder. I assume the code would be the more interesting part to view.
