                <P>I always struggle with more open assignments, I am not the creative type.
                I decided, I like video games, I spend most of my free time with video game.
                Making a few, <i>simple</i>, games comes more naturally then a store page.
                I dont feel like making this an uphill battle, so thats what I am sticking with. 
                <br><br>I hope you enjoy something in here, because this was tedious.</P>

            <td><p>Simon says is a classic that every one should be familiar with. 
                This version is pretty hard as the pattern is new every round, (It makes the code more interesting). 
                Just a fair warning, if a color is lit for longer than usual, that means it was used multiple times in a row.</p>

                Again, not trying to reinvent the wheel here. 
                The dealer is a little dumb, so don't go too hard.</p>

                I looked into seeing if you could use vectors in JS/HTML, and saw that it is possible with jquery.
                <i>Perfect.</i></p>
